Keep in mind that in the default rendering the "up" direction is X and the other axes follow the right-hand rule.

          This is useful for different packing methods. E.g., Utilizing "2,0,1" would pack a shipping container first in the Y(width) direction, then in the X(height) direction, and finally in the Z(length) direction, replication a floor-to-ceiling, front-to-back loading method.

'weight' is by weight, descending. 'density' is by item weight per unit volume, descending. It can often be worth attempting packs with competing itemSorts and picking the lowest cost option. 'all' uses all available item sorts, whereas 'combined' uses a recommended set of item sorts, both returning the lowest 'totalCost' option.

A value of 1 signifies that only the first item (and others still unpacked from its ItemSet) will have every orientation attempted and the engine subsequently selecting the most performant. A value of 2 signifies that the first groups of unpacked items, each sharing an ItemSet, will have every combination of orientation attempted. Increasing this value from 1 can very rapidly result in excessive complexity and a timeout error instead of a result, so discretion is advised. Requesting a depth in excess of the maximum will return a warning and allow the request the complete with the setting reduced to its maximum.

It costs $2 per item, whereas Box B is $2.50 per item. Box A is opened, 6 items are placed inside, and now 2 remain. To pack the last 2, Box B would be selected, as 2 items for $10 is $5 per item, and Box A's $12 is $6 per item.</p><p>Alternatively, if 'boxTypeChoiceLookahead' is set to 1, the boxType that provides the lowest cost per item <i>including</i> the lookahead boxType(s) would be selected. In this case, we find we need 2 of Box B, for $20 total, to fit all 8 items, or $2.50 per item, and would need 1 of Box A and 1 of Box B if Box A is selected first, for $22 total or $2.75 per item. Box B would be used.</p><p>Please note that 'boxTypeChoiceLookahead', especially when combined with the 'actual' 'boxTypeChoiceStyle' can have significant performance impacts. 0 is recommended for real-time use cases.</p>

        description: Control the ability for partially-filled boxes to allow packing of later-sorted items. When used with `sequence`, it can greatly reduce item set fragmentation across multiple containers and improve consolidation, sometimes at the expense of overall container count and volume utilization. A value of null or -1 means unlimited lookback is permitted, i.e., every box can be used to pack any allowable item that fits regardless of its pack sequence, and all boxes will remain "opened" or available for packing until the last item in the pack sequence is attempted. A value of 0 means lookback is not allowed, and as soon as the next item in the pack sequence does not fit into a partially filled box, that box is "closed" or locked and will not permit any additional items (i.e., out-of-sequence items) to be packed in it.

          Additional properties to track per unit, which are all returned in the response. 
          Numerical properties can be used in conjunction with box type `propertyConstraints` to control packing (very much akin to weight constraints). 

          E.g., an item property on a Faberge egg of `"priceless-egg-quantity": 1` with a matching constraint of `"key": "priceless-egg-quantity", "max": 2, "aggregate": "sum"` would limit to 2 Faberge eggs per box.

          Another box constraint with `"key": "priceless-egg-quantity", "max": 0` instead would effectively prohibit any items with that quantity from packing in it, similar to an exclude rule. 

          Conversely, each egg could have its own insurance amount, and there may be a maximum allowable amount per box, such as `"priceless-egg-value": 33000000` for one and `"priceless-egg-value": 22000000` for a second (for $55 million total) with a corresponding constraint of `"key": "priceless-egg-value", "max": 50000000` would prevent both eggs from being placed in one box, as $55 million exceeds the $50 million constraint on a single box (and they would be placed in their own boxes insured for $33 million and $22 million respectively'

                  it will be shipped as if it were a 12" x 12" x 60" item. Rolls can have a maximum allowable diameter, and any rolls that must be
                  split will have their weights calculated on a pro-rated basis of the total length and weight in the item contents.<p/>

        description: Instead of providing the full rate table, you can list a carton "basePrice" and a carton "priceIncreaseRate". These two values will be used in a simple linear model to guess carton price, i.e., <pre>cartonPrice = priceIncreaseRate * cartonWeight + basePrice</pre> Oftentimes, this will be enough to get accurate carton selections without needing to send complete customer-based rates. It's worth considering, as the prices are only estimates to be used in carton selection, with final rating of cartons happening outside of paccurate. This is the predicted rate of increase for a weight-based pricing model. The simplest way to find a serviceable value is to take <pre>priceIncreaseRate = (maximumPrice - minimumPrice)/(maximumWeight - minimumWeight)</pre> In the example above, this would yield <pre>priceIncreaseRate = ($20-$10)/(3lbs-1lb)<br/>priceIncreaseRate = $10/2lbs<br/>priceIncreaseRate = $5/lb</pre>

      basePrice:
        description: The basePrice can be found by estimating the lowest weight-based rate available for a given service, in the example above, solving for basePrice for a $10, 1lb package with the already-solved priceIncreaseRate yields <pre>$10 = $5/lb * 1lb + basePrice<br/>$10 = $5 + basePrice<br/>basePrice = $5</pre>

        description: This is the Dimensional Weight divisor. It is given in units of volume per unit weight, e.g., the standard of "139" represents 139 cubic inches per pound, and is used to convert the total volume of a carton into a functional minimum weight to be used when rating the carton. E.g., a carton with dimensions 10" x 10" x 13.9" would yield a volume of 1390 cubic inches. This yields <pre>cartonEffectiveMinimumWeight = 1390in&sup3; / 139in&sup3;/lb<br/>cartonEffectiveMinimumWeight = 10lbs</pre>. To disable when using a preset carrier and zone, set to -1 or a very big number.
